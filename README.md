<p dir="auto">I wanted to share a board I created, thanks to various expert guides found online, to manage my Samsung Q70 55&rsquo; TV</p>
<p dir="auto">Instructions:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>in HA create the label: Luci, prese, presenza ecc. (mine have these names in Italian) if you change them, in the sensor file where you then adapt them</li>
<li>from Hacs, install:<br />a. bubble-card</li>
<li>in the HA file sensor.yaml, insert the contents of sensor.txt (READ the first line), if you do not have the file:<br />a. you must create sensor.yaml in the config/ folder<br />b. open the file configuration.yaml and insert this line: sensor: !include sensor.yaml</li>
<li>create a new badge in HA (see image below, green square) and select entities: sensor.luci_accese (to sum up the lights on) or prese_accese (to sum up the switch on) or presences</li>
</ol>
